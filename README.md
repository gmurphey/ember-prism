# Ember-prism

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/brandonjmckay/ember-prism.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project aims to make re-usable ember components for [PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/).
This project is packaged as an [EmberCLI](http://www.ember-cli.com) addon.

## Installation

Install the ember-cli addon in your ember-cli project:

```
$ ember install ember-prism
```

## Usage

### Using components

We have two main components, `code-block`, and `code-inline`. They'll take care of running Prism on your code as you transition.

You may need to use `&lt;`, and `&gt;` html attributes to escape `<`, and `>` characters so they aren't removed by Handlebars.

```handlebars
{{#code-block language='markup'}}//Can be left blank for the default
  &lt;a href='link'&gt;value&lt;/a&gt;
{{/code-block}}
```

### Configuration

You can set which theme, components, and plugins you'd like to use from Prism.

```javascript
//ember-cli-build.js
var app = new EmberApp({
  'ember-prism': {
    'theme': 'twilight',
    'components': ['scss', 'javascript'], //needs to be an array, or undefined.
    'plugins': ['line-highlight']
  }
})
```

If you want to use the default theme, just remove the `theme` option completely.

### Usage from another addon

If you want to enclude ember-prism from another addon, you'll need to do two things.
First, make sure your addon's default blueprint installs the Prism Bower package.

```js
// blueprints/<addon-name>/index.js
var installPrismBowerPackage = require('ember-prism/blueprints/ember-prism').installPrismBowerPackage;

module.exports = {
  // ...

  afterInstall: function(options) {
    return installPrismBowerPackage(this).then(function() {
      // ...any other logic your blueprint needs
    });
  }
};
```

Second, import all the required CSS and JS for Prism into the app's dependency tree.

```js
// index.js
var importPrismSources = require('ember-prism').importPrismSources;

module.exports = {
  // ...

  included: function(app) {
    importPrismSources(app, { /* options to ember-prism */ });
    // ...
  }
};
```
